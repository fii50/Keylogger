# Keylogger
There are two keyloggers; 
1- Winsercon0-1W 
it is a keylogger that records key presses, it as well takes a screen shot periodically. However  it is noticeably
slowing the computer.

2-WinDsercon0-1W
it is only recording the key presses, and it is not slowing the computer until it needs to send the file to the 
email. Yet it is fine.
